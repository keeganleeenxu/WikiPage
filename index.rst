   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to EEWiki Demo's documentation!
=======================================
For the task, please create content on a topic that can give us an idea of the work you would be able to do for the wiki. It doesn't have to be very long or thorough (for guidance let's say equivalent to up to two sides of A4) and it doesn't necessarily have to be in the form of a wiki page or a webpage. Once again, something to give us an idea. Please send us the pdf or a link by 6pm of Friday 14th June. 

include the following:
each page is a unique topic
exam style questions
glossary/cheat sheet

FOR DEMO:
show multiple pages
show data in different formats:
- tables
- graphs
- images
- code
